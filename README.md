SP26 PURPLE BUDGET APP
App's name: FlowMoney


Background: The Purple Budget App is a user-friendly and efficient tool to aid individuals to track and manage their finances. With an increasing demand in digital solutions for personal finance, this app aims to empower users to make informed decisions, set financial goals and know what to do with their monthly income in the future.

Objectives:
    Expenses tracking: Develop a platform allowing users to record and categorize their monthly income and spendings effortlessly.
    User-friendly interface: Design an intuitive and appealing user-interface to enhance the overall user experience, making financial management accessible to diverse people.
    Privacy and Security: Prioritize the implementation of security to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of userâ€™s financial data.


Scope: The app will cover the following feature:
    - User registration and authentication
    - Interactive dashboard that displays balance amount, expenses, and monthly income.
    - Data visualization through the graph and chart that shows the relationship between the spending and income monthly.
    - Transaction history.

The app will not involve the connection to the real bank account to ensure user privacy and legal compliance. Instead, this project will stimulate sample financial data within the apps.
